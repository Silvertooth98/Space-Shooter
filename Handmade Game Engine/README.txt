Thanks for downloading Handmade. I hope you enjoy using it!

For full documentation please read the Manual which is located in the Documentation folder, situated inside the main project folder. Please also find some useful tutorials in there to get you started. All documentation is still a WIP, so please bear with me as I haven't had much time to fully polish them up.
