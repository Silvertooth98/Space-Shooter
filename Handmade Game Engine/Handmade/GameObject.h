  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This class encapsulates a game object that will exist in the game world and represent any type
  of object like a player, enemy, weapon, inventory item, etc. It is designed around the same 
  principle as Unity's game objects and will be instantiated in the client code at runtime from 
  within the game specific code. It consists of three main flags, m_isAlive, m_isActive and 
  m_isVisible, to signify if the object is exisiting in memory, being used in the game world and 
  hidden or not from the game world, respectively. Each game object also has a string tag to 
  identify it amongst other objects, and a priority value for 2D game worlds without a Z-axis, 
  so that game objects may be drawn in a specific order to give the illusion of depth. Each game
  object automatically has a matrix to represent its transformation in terms of position, rotation
  and scale. For more flexible rotations, a Quaternion component is also present. All game objects
  need to be instantiated as sub-classes of this abstract base class.

- There are a few static variables and functions which were added to allow global access to the
  game object's main properties, that belong to the game object. Of these is the model matrix, 
  because we only need one matrix to represent the object's transformation. This works similar to
  the way the old fixed function OpenGL controlled model matrices. The static functions allow for
  the model matrix to be reset to the identity, transformed accordingly and passed to the vertex
  shader. 
  There is also a PushMatrix() and PopMatrix() routine, which works similar to the old fixed 
  function OpenGL, that allows the global model matrix to be temporarily "bookmarked" so that
  temporary transformations may be applied (push) afterwhich we can revert back to the older 
  transformations (pop). This feature works nicely with parent and child transformations.		

- The getters and setters are split into normal ones and combo variants. The combo variants, 
  IsAlive(), IsActive() and IsVisible() return references to the respective variables because these
  flag variables may be used frequently and getting and setting them individually may become 
  inconvenient.

- Each game object has a Update() and Draw() function which will be overriden in the sub-class, 
  where the actual main functionality of that object will exist. Generally the Update() routine
  is there for the updating of all position, rotation and scale values, alongside others. The Draw()
  function is intended for all transformations to be applied to the internal model matrix, as well
  as components and other objects being drawn.

- The Create() and Destroy() functions are there so we can manually set up the game object's 
  components. This prevents issues when creating game objects globally or statically because then
  if we were to set up the components in the ctor, some 3rd party libraries that we depend on may
  not have been loaded in time, causing a crash!
