- This game state monitors the beginning state of the game. Things like menu's, start up screens,
  splash screens, etc are intended to be used here. This particular state consists of two 
  SplashScreen objects, which will draw two splash screen images before the Main State begins. It 
  will wait for one splash screen image to fade in and out before the next one becomes active.
  The OnEnter() function will create and compile the main game's vertex and fragment shaders as 
  well. These shaders are then only destroyed in the End State's OnExit() function so that they
  remain active throughout the program.
