- This game object represents the 2D camera that is needed to render 2D objects on screen, such as
  the HUD or text. It works as a secondary camera to the main camera and should be called before
  each 2D object is rendered. The Draw() function will simply reset the camera component's view
  matrix to the identity, which is all we need as a view before rendering our 2D objects.
  This camera should not be confused with the main camera's 2D setting, which is for orthographic
  view in games, and is treated separately to this one.
