  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This class encapsulates a game state that will exist within the game. A game state can be 
  anything like a play state, pause state, menu state, etc and will contain all the game
  specific code specific to that state. Every game state needs to be instantiated as a 
  sub-class of this abstract base class. Ideally, the instantiated game states will be created
  and controlled inside the Game class, which serves as the game state machine.
  
- The main flag variable m_isActive will keep track if the game state is currently active or not. 
  As long as its active, its overriden Update() and Draw() routines will constantly be called until
  the state is set as not active, at which point the state will close down. As soon as the state
  is flagged as not alive, it will be removed by the state machine.
  
- The OnEnter() routine is called when the state is activated and this function will load all 
  resources from file, instantiate the game objects for that state and do all start up tasks for the
  active state. The opposing OnExit() function will do the opposite when the state is deactivated, 
  ie - call all shutdown tasks, remove all game objects from memory and free all resources from 
  memory for the given state.
