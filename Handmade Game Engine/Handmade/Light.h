- This class encapsulates a light component in the game world. It comprises of all lighting 
  properties that will affect the lighting calculations in the fragment shader. The light itself
  can also be drawn and this is for debug purposes to see where the light is in the scene. In
  particular the Create(), Update(), Draw() and Destroy() functions are for DEBUG only and are
  there to create and render an actual "light bulb" in the scene. The SendToShader() function
  passes all the light properties to the fragment shader to be processed to light up the scene
  accordingly.
