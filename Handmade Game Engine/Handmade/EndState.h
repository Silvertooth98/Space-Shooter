- This game state monitors the final state of the game. Things like credits, end screens, final
  messages, etc are intended to be used here. This particular state consists of only one single
  SplashScreen object, which will render the final credits message splash screen before the 
  application ends for good. The OnExit() routine will destroy the main game's vertex and fragment
  shaders that were created and compiled in the Start State's OnEnter() function.
